# Dev setup

My local setup steps to get a dev environment up and running in windows with WSL running OpenSUSE. Goals are to use something like Ansible or Terraform to codify setups.

[Windows](windows.md)

[Mac](mac.md)

[Shared Configs](shared.md)

Symlinks are a way to get dotfiles linked, but read this https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles for an alternate approach.

## Common software between both setups
- Insomnia - REST client
