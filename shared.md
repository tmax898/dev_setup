## Shared tooling and apps

These are all the cross platform tools to remember to install reguardless of OS.

### Software

#### Browser
- Chrome - Better than the default OS, normal use plenty of support, getting sketchier reguarding PII (not that it wasn't already).
- [Brave](https://brave.com) - better privacy. Pick this over firefox or duck.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download) - Notes
  - Install Git Sync and sync with git repo. This will pull any other plugins as well.
  - If running into GPG issues refer to https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git/issues/21

#### Communication tools

- Discord
- Slack

#### Coding Tools

Installations of different langs and sdks will be left in the respective OS guides.
- [Install Hyper](https://hyper.is/) - general use crossplatform terminal. Each OS has alternatives to avoid running an electron apps a terminal.

- Neovim - in-terminal editor. A set of configs will get uploaded eventually. Kickstart will be the base set of configurations. Use respective OS package manager.
  - TODO: double chcek that Mason has everything they need in the configs. If they do delete this otherwise list out all the LSPs, Linters, and formatters needed.
  - Alternatively [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    - Extensions:
      - Nightowl - theme
      - rust
      - zig
      - eslint
      - prettier
      - code spell check
  - Another alternative is Helix - This still is missing much of what Neovim provides as of the writing of this guide.
    - Follow up with the [Helix Setup](helix.md)
  - Nerdfonts - Each OS will walk through their own setup. Way more complicated than it ever should be to install a font.
